### *Lenders Club data Analysis*
Financial flexibility is essential in today's dynamic and fast-paced environment. Whether it's for debt consolidation, home improvement projects, or unforeseen medical bills, many individuals and small companies frequently require financial assistance. We propose analyzing the Lending Club dataset to learn about the factors that influence loan approvals. This study will give an understanding of the complex dynamics of loan decisions, which will assist both borrowers and lenders. We can help increase access to credit for everybody by understanding the underlying mechanisms of credit choices.

Analysis aims to address the following key research questions: 
1. How can we predict an applicantâ€™s approval odds factoring in the probability that they will pay their loan in full or that it will be charged off.
2. What are the primary factors that significantly influence the loan Status of the applications? 
3. To what extent do financial attributes, including credit scores, income levels, and employment history, contribute to the lending decision process?
